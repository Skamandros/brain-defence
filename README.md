# brain-defence

Pyglet tower defense game for Global Game Jam 2024 "Make it laugh"

Idea:
- Defend the brain against negative ideas, influences and bad jokes by converting them with towers into positive thinking.
- Towers are happy thoughts (dogs, kitten throwers, chocolate, booze)
- The game is won once enough happy thoughts have reached the brain to make it laugh.
